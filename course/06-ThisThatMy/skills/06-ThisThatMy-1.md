# ​This & That
## Demonstrative Pronouns and Adjectives
* As in English, the same words (this, that, those, etc.) are used as demonstrative pronouns (DP) (to point out something) and demonstrative adjectives (DA) (to say that something has some characteristic - red, big, etc.).

### Word order - Demonstrative Pronouns
* When used as a pronoun, the word order is Demonstrative Pronoun + Noun/Noun phrase (Subject(S)) + Verb.
* Examples:
* Hau (DP) kotxea(S) da(V). : This is the car. (lit: This car is.)
* Hau (DP) kotxe(N) gorria(A) da(V). : This is the red car.(note: “kotxe gorria” is a noun phrase that is the object of the sentence and “Hau” is the subject.

### Word order - Demonstrative Adjectives
* When used as an adjective, the Demonstrative Adjectives (DA) is the last item in the noun phrase (Noun (N), Adjective(A), demonstrative adjective(DA) and is used with a complementary adjective(CA)  and a verb(V).
* Note that when a demonstrative adjective is used, adjectives and noun in the rest of the noun phrase use the plain form (gorri not gorria or gorriak).
* Examples:
* Kotxe(N) hau(DA) gorria(CA) da(V).: This car is red.
* Kotxe(N) gorri(A) hau (S(DA)) handia(CA) da(V). : This red car is big. (Note in the subject noun phrase “Kotxe gorri hau” neither kotxe or gorri have a grammatical ending as hau fills that role.
