# 39. Eduki 1
## 39.1  Eduki - Ergative case/NORK
* Note: Basque has two words for “to have”, Eduki and Ukan (which is also used as the auxiliary verb for non-conjugated transitive verbs).
* Eduki is common in Spain, but seldom used in France.
* Word order in Basque can be very flexible, but normally for transitive verbs it is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).
* As with intransitive verbs, when adjectives are used, they follow the noun,
* the noun doesn’t change and the grammar suffix is added to the last adjective in the noun phrase.

### Transitive verb conjugation
* In the examples below, note that “to have” with a single object is dauka- with the endings -t, -zu, -. -gu, -zue, -te
* (nik daukat, zuk daukazu, hark dauka, guk daukagu, zuek daukazue, haiek daukate)
* while “to have” with a plural object is dauzka-  with same endings of -t, -zu, -. -gu, -zue, -te
* (nik dauzkat, zuk dauzkazu, hark dauzka, guk dauzkagu, zuek dauzkazue, haiek dauzkate).
* You will see the pattern of  da- for third person object, the stem, in this case -uka/ukazka- with the endings, -t, -zu, -. -gu, -zue, -(z)te
* used with other verbs.
* For example jakin, to know (da- + -ki/kizki- +endings
* nik dakit/dakizkit, zuk dakizu/dakizkizu, hark daki/dakizki, guk dakigu/dakizkigu, zuek dakizue/dakizkizue, haiek dakite/dakizkite
* and the auxiliary verb Ukan/Edun (d- + -u/itu- + endings)
* nik dut/ditut, zuk duzu/dituzu, hark du/ditu, guk dugu/ditugu, zuek duzue/dituzue, haiek dute/dituzte
* Note: Nork pronouns end in -k (nik, zuk, hark, guk, zuek, haiek)

## The NORK case:
* The chart below shows the main parts of the NORK-NOR (ergative -absolutive) case in Basque.
* The NORK (ergative) case is used with the subject of transitive verbs (verbs which have objects)
* while the object of the verb is in the NOR (absolutive) case, which is the case used for the subject of intransitive verbs, and was covered earlier.
* Example: Txakurra gaztea da. The dog is young.(txakurra is the intransitive verb subject)
* Mikelek txakurra dauka. Michael has the dog.(txakurra is the transitive verb object)

### Nork Case
* Indefinite
* -(e)k
* mendik
* Single definite
* -ak
* mendiak
* Plural definite
* -ek
* mendiek
* Proper names
* -(e)k
* Mikelek

### -rik
* As was covered in module 20, the Basque word for any is the suffix -rik.
* When using -rik, you  just add -rik to the no article form. Ex: diru = money, dirurik. = any money.
* As with English, -rik is normally used with negative sentences. The subject doesn’t have any of the object. Also note -rik makes the object single.


### Eduki 1

* Zuk daukazu: You have it
* Hark dauka: He/she/it has it
* Guk daukagu: We have it
* Zuek daukazue: You (plural) have it

* diru: money
