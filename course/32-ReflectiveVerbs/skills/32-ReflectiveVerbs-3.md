# 32 Reflective Verbs 3
## 32.1 Reflective Verbs
* Additional reflective verbs that take the dative include: kostatu (cost)), iruditu (seemed), berdin(same),gelditu (remained, left).
* Some of the reflective verbs can also be used non-reflectively.
* Such as "Ardo gutzi gelditu da." "Little wine remains."
* and reflectively (Niri) "Ardo gutzi gelditu zait." "Little wine remains for me."
* Berdin was introduced earlier to mean "the same" in greetings and can also be used with the auxiliary izan as in "Berdin da." "It is the same./It doesn't matter."
* It can also be used reflectively as in "(Niri) Berdin zait." "It is the same to me./I don't care."
* Berdin uses the helper word izan, like "ahal izan", introdcued earlier, so past is "berdin izan" and future is "berdin izango".
* The dative form of the auxilary verb can also be used with non-reflective verbs.
* "Zaldiak etortzen zaizkit." "The horses come to me."
