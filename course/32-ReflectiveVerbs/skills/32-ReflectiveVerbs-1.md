# 32 Reflective Verbs 1
## Grammar: Reflective Verbs
* A few intransitive verbs are used reflectively, for example, the verb “gustatu” (to please) is used reflectively to mean “to like”.
* So to say “Do you like it?” you would say “(Zuri hura) gustatzen zaizu?” (Is it pleasing to you?).
* Pronouns, such as “zuri” & “hura”, are not normally used in common speech, as the verb tells who the subject and indirect object are
* and including pronouns makes it rather emphatic, (Is it pleasing to YOU. (not to someone else))
* but they will be used in the course to teach and reinforce the pronouns.
* The Sentence structure for dative sentences is normally Indirect object + Subject + (Direct Object) + main verb + dative from of the auxiliary verb,
* with the direct object only being present for transitive verbs.
* So the sentence structure for “(Zuri hura) gustatzen zaizu?” is the Indirect object: zuri (to you) + the Subject: hura(it)
* + the main verb: gustatzen + the dative of the auxiliary verb: zaizu.
* However, the order can be modified based on what the speaker wants to emphasis.
* For this verb, the item being liked can come before the verbs or after, but can’t come between,
* so I like coffee.(Coffee is pleasing to me.) can be “(Niri)Kafea gustatzen zait.” or “(Niri) Gustatzen zait kafea.”
* or for plural objects I like owls (Owls are pleasing to me.) (Niri)Hontzak gustatzen zaizkit or  (Niri)gustatzen zaizkit hontzak.
* For negative sentences, the order is, again, changed and “ez” needs to be next to the conjugated verb.
* “(Niri) Ez zait gustatzen.” or “(Niri) Gustatzen ez zait.” (I don’t like it./It is not pleasing to me.)
* “(Niri) Ez zaizkit gustatzen.” or “(Niri) Gustatzen ez zaizkit.” (I don’t like them./They are not pleasing to me.).
* While “ez” and the verb must be together, other elements can be moved to show emphasis, so “I don’t like snakes./Snakes are not pleasing to me.” can be
* “(Niri) Sugeak ez zaizkit gustatzen.” or “(Niri) Ez zaizkit sugeak gustatzen.” or  “(Niri) Ez zaizkit gustatzen sugeak.”
* Other reflective verbs that take the dative include: interesatu (interested in), kostatu (cost)), iruditu (seemed), berdin(same),gelditu (remained, left).
## 32.1   Grammar: NORI Verb Construction (Dative)
* When intransitive verbs are used in the dative case, there are only normally only two (NOR) subjects used he/she/it, which have the prefix “za”
* or they, which has the prefix “zaizk”.
* A NORI suffix is then added to form the dative verb (to me -it, to you -izu, to him, her -io, to us -igu, to you (plural) -izue,  to them  -ie)
* Single indirect single object(za-)/Plural indirect plural object (zaizk-)
* niri zait/zaizkit
* zuri zaizu/zaizkizu
* hari zaio/zaizkio
* guri zaigu/zaizkigu
* zuei zaizue/zaizkizue
* haiei zaie/zaizkie
