# 9. To Be or Not To Be - Egon and the NON(Inessive) Case
## Egon (To Be)
* Southern Basque (like Spanish) has two different verbs that can be translated as "to be"; Izan and Egon.
* Izan, discussed earlier, is used for facts or  qualities that are fairly permanent, fixed attributes of something.
* For example:
    * Mutila naiz. I am a boy.
    * Hura handia da. He is big.
    * Ni Italiarra naiz. I am Italian.

* Egon is used to express temporary states or locations. For example:
    * Mutila zikina dago. The boy is dirty.
    * Mikel Donostian dago. Mikel is in San Sebastian.
    * Euskal herrian dago. He/She is in Basque country.
    * Etxean nago. I am at home.

* Northern Basque (in France) does not have this distinction, so "to be" is translated as izan in almost all contexts.
* In Northern Basque, egon is used to mean "to stay" instead of "to be", so
* "Euskal herrian dago" would mean "I am staying in  Basque Country" not "I am in Basque Country".

* Note that both Egon and Izan are also used to describe feelings. Nekatuta nago. I am tired.(Emotions will be covered later in this course).

* When using Egon (or Izan in Northern Basque) to show that a subject is in or at a location you need to use the Inessive case, which answers the question NON - where.

## Inessive(NON) Case
* The inessive NON case is only used with inanimate objects and is used to show the subject is in, on or upon something/someplace.
* In this lesson you will be introduced to the single definite form of the NON - Inessive
* The NON - Inessive case is used to show that the subject(s) is in/on/upon the ojbect(s).
* Single definite
    *   Ending: -(E)AN
    *   Examples: etxeAN (in a house) haranEAN (in a valley)
* When adding suffixes, A+E = E, A+A=A, others are added, like exEEtan.

* Egon can  also be used to mean "There is" or "There are" (Hontza da/dago There is an owl), but normally to emphasis the existence of something, the affirmative particle "ba-" is used with the conjugated verbs and placed before the subject. - Badago hontza.
* Note that the ba- particle is not used with negative sentences.
    * Txoria dago zuhaitzean.  The bird is in the tree.
    * Badago txori bat zuhaitzean. There is a bird in the tree.
    * Ez dago txori zuhaitzean. There is not a bird in the tree.
