# 30 Compound Verbs 1-1
##  30.1  Compound Verbs Grammar
* A few verbs, like ahal izan(can/be able to), behar izan(have to/must), ezin(cannot), nahi izan(want to), behar, and balio are "compound" verbs
* (aditz elkartuak in Basque) because they use an auxilary verb izan/ukan to show tense.
*   Ahal Izan is used with verbs to give the meaning of “To be able” or “can” to a particular action.
*   Behar Izan is used with verbs to give the meaning of “have to” or “must” do a particular action.
*   Ezin  is used with verbs to give the meaning of  “cannot”.
* These verbs use the conjugated form of either the verb Izan or Ukan, depending on if the verb is intransitive (does not take an object)
* or transitive (takes an object). This section will cover the use compound verbs with intransitive verbs.
* The use of compound verbs with transitive verbs will be covered later.
### Ahal Izan, Behar Izan and Ezin in the past tense
* Ahal Izan, Behar Izan and Ezin in the remote and near past.
* In the past form, the dictionary form of the verb is used, with ahal izan. behar izan or ezin,
* and the past(for far past) or present (for near past) form of the verb “izan”.
* As with normal non-declined verbs, far past is normally prior to that day and the near past is earlier that day.
* Remote Past:  Atzo joan ahal izan nintzen.    I could/was able to go yesterday.
* Near Past:       Gaur joan ahal izan naiz.        I could/was able to go today.
* Remote Past:  Atzo joan behar izan nintzen. I had to go yesterday.
* Near Past:       Gaur joan behar izan naiz.      I had to go today.
* Remote Past:  Atzo ezin nintzen joan.           I could not go yesterday.
* Near Past:       Gaur ezin naiz joan.                I could not go today.
* (Note, that for ezin, just like with “ez” the word order changes, and the verb goes to the end.)
