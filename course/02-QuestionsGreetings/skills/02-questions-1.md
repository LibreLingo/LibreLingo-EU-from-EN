# â€‹Questions 1
### Yes/No Questions:
* The easiest way to make a question is to change the tone to a rising one.
* Miren zara zu? Are you Miren?
### "al" question word
* Alternatively, you can be a bit more polite/formal and add "al" and ask "Miren al zara zu?"
* Note that the "al" is before the conjugated verb.
* You also need to keep in mind that Basque sentences have the most important pronoun or noun before the verb.
* So "Zu irakaslea (al) zara?" ("al" optional) means "Are you a teacher?" with irakaslea/teacher stressed.
* In other words, I thought you were the janitor. :-)
* "Zu al zara irakaslea?" would be "Are you THE teacher?" with "zu" stressed or I thought the guy in a tie by the desk was the teacher. :-)

### Interrogative questions
Interrogative questions (as opposed to yes/no questions) use question words, such as:
* Zer (what) and nor/nortzunk (who(single/plural)), and take the form of Question word * verb *
subject.
* Nor zara zu? Who are you?
* Zer zara zu? What are you?
