# â€‹Greetings 1
### Greetings
If you ever go hiking in the Basque Country, such as on the Camino del Norte, expect to often receive a cheerful "Kaixo" as you trek through the stunningly beautiful scenery.

### Vocabulary Greetings 1
* Arratsalde on: Good Afternoon (12:00 to 20:00)
* Barkatu: Excuse me/Sorry
* Egun on: Good morning (morning to 12)
* Eskerrik asko: Thank you ("many thanks")
* Ondo: Fine, Well
* Bai: Yes
* Zer moduz?: How are you? (literally just "how?")
* nago: I am (egon)

### egon
* In response to Zer moduz? you chould just say ondo, but might be considered a bit rude
* Better to give a complete sentence "Ni ondo nago."
* Nago means "I am" like naiz, but is only used for temporary things.
* The egon  case will be discussed in Unit 9. So for now just remember to use it when responding to Zer Moduz.
* unless you are feeling terrible, and then you can answer with a response to be taught later. :-)
