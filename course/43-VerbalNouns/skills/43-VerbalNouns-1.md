# 43. Verbal Nouns 1
## Verbal nouns & NORA case
* When we want to talk about how we like or dislike doing something or being someplace, or that we are going to do something or be someplace,
* we often use a verbal noun—a noun made from the verb.
* In English, the verbal noun can either be like the present participle (writing), or use the word “to” with the simple form of the verb (to write).
* In Basque, the verbal noun is made the same way as  the present participle, with the final -n removed.
* Ni inoiz ez hemen itxaoten naiz. I never wait here.(itxaoten/wait is a present participle)
* Niri ez zait gustatzen itxaote. I don’t like to wait/waiting. Waiting is not pleasing to me. (itxaote/to wait/waiting is a verbal noun)
* Note that a verbal noun is different from the present continuous case, even if both have -ing.
* So “I am running.” “Ni korrika ari naiz” is present continuous and was covered earlier in 41 Ari Izan.
