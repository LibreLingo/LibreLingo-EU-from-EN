# Verbs1-2

## Non-conjugated Intransitive verbs
* All verbs have non-conjugated form, meaning they do are not conjugated, but are used with a helper verb (Izan or Ukan).
* Some verbs are also conjugated, change the form with tense and subject, and will be studied later.
* Intransitive Verbs are verbs that do not take an object, meaning can’t answer “what”) use IZAN as an auxilary verb
* Ex:You can say “What did he do?, but not “What did he go? So “go” is intransitive and uses IZAN.

### Near past
* The near past is used for past actions in present time frame, usually earlier that day.
* It is formed with the perfect stem + present of“to be” (IZAN)
* Ni gaur iristi naiz. I arrived today.
* Note that bizi didn't have a near past as it doesn't make sense to have lived one place prior to today,
* another place this morning and yet another now.
