# 26. NORTAZ 1
## Instrumental case NORTAZ: By what means?
* Below are are the ways to form the NORAZ case, but in this lesson we will just use the Indefinite
* Indefinite
*   -(e)z
*   oinez(by foot)
* Single definite
*   -az
*   oinaz(by the foot)
* Plural definite
*   -(e)z,(e)taz
*   oinez (by the feet)
* Proper names
*   -az
*   espainieraz (by/in Spanish)
* Note : if a plural noun ends in a vowel, add -ez/etaz/ if a consonant, add -z/taz
* The instrumental can be widely used to describe objects, people or ideas that do something, but in normal speech, not literary usage,
*   it is mostly used to describe means of transportation (Trenez joaten naiz. I go by train.),
*   to change nouns to adverbs(arreta care - arretaz carefully) and languages (euskaraz - in Basque).
* The indefinite form of the instrumental is used in numerous expressions, such as:
*   Gauez ibiltzen naiz. I walk at night.
*   Oinez joaten naiz.  I go by foot.
*   Liburua ingelesez dago. The book is in English.
*   Seinaleak euskaraz daude. The signs are in Basque
* Note: Remember, the conjugated form of verbs, such as Etorri (nator, zatoz, dator, gatoz, zatozte, datoz)
*   is the equivalent of the present continuous form in English, that being something you are in the process of doing, now or around now.
*    “I am coming from school by bus.” (now) (Ni eskolatik autobusez nator.),
* while the non-conjugated form is used for things done habitually “I come from school every day by bus.” (Ni egunero etortzen naiz eskolatik autobusez.).
* Similarly, the past form of conjugated verbs represents the past continuous, “I was coming from school by bus.”(Eskolatik autobusez nentorren.).
*  vs non-conjugated I came home from school by bus every day.(Egunero etortzen nintzen eskolatik autobusez.)
