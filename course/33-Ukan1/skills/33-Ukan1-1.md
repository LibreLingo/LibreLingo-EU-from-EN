# 33. Ukan/Edun 1-1
## 33.1  Ukan - Ergative case/NORK
* There are two names for the auxiliary verb used for non-conjugated transitive verbs, Ukan and Edun.
* You will see one or the other or both in literature, but they refer to the same set of words.
* Transitive verbs are those that can answer the question “what”, and Ukan/Edun is used, throughout the region,
* as the auxiliary verb for transitive verbs, in a similar manner to how IZAN is used with non-transitive verbs.
* Ukan/Edun can also be used to mean “to have”, and is a synonym with Eduki, which is common in Spain, but seldom used in France.
* Eduki will be covered later
### Auxiliary verb Ukan/Edun conjugated
* Ukan/Edun with a single object is du- with the endings -t, -zu, -. -gu, -zue, -te
* (nik dut, zuk duzu, hark du,  guk dugu, zuek duzue, haiek dute)
* This is a pattern you will see with other conjugated transitive verbs.
* Verbs used with Ukan/Edun follow the same form as with Izan.
* For the near past, the dictionary form is combined with Ukan/Edun. For example Nik egin dut. I did it.
* Word order in Basque can be very flexible, but normally for transitive verbs it is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).
* As with intransitive verbs, when adjectives are used, they follow the noun,
* the noun doesn’t change and the grammar suffix is added to the last adjective in the noun phrase.
* Gaur nik poltsa urdina ireki dut. Today I opened the blue purse.
* Subject: Nik, Object: Noun: poltsa Adjective: urdina, Verb: Main Verb: ireki Auxiliary verb: dut.

### Near past
* As with intrasitive, the near past is an event that happened in the present time from, usually that day
* for example: Guar nik euskaraz hitz egin dut.
* Today I spoke Basque.
* As with intransitive verbs, when used in the negative. Didn’t do something, ez goes with the noun.
* Nik ez dut liburua irakurri. I didn’t read the book.

## The NORK case:
* The chart below shows the main parts of the NORK-NOR (ergative -absolutive) case in Basque.
* The NORK (ergative) case is used with the subject of transitive verbs (verbs which have objects)
* while the object of the verb is in the NOR (absolutive) case,
* which is the case used for the subject of intransitive verbs, that was covered earlier.
* Example: Txakurra gaztea da. The dog is young.(txakurra is the intransitive verb subject)
* Mikelek txakurra dauka. Michael has the dog.(txakurra is the transitive verb object, while Mikelek is the subject)

### Nork Case
* Indefinite
* -(e)k
* mendik
* Single definite
* -ak
* mendiak
* Plural definite
* -ek
* mendiek
* Proper names
* -(e)k
* Mikelek

### -rik
* As was covered in module 20, Because 1, the Basque word for any is the suffix -rik.
* When using -rik, you  just add -rik to the no article form. Ex: diru = money, dirurik. = any money.
* As with English, -rik is normally used with negative sentences. The subject doesn’t have any of the object. Also note -rik makes the object single.


### Ukan/Edun 1-1
* Note that the following are translated as have/has, but remember they also can be used as auxiliary verbs
* and that is how they will be used in this lesson for the sentences.
* Nik dut: I have (single object)
* Zuk duzu: You have (single object)
* Hark du: He/she/it has (single object)
* Guk dugu: We have (single object)
* Zuek duzue: You (plural) have (single object)
* Haiek dute: They have (single object)
* ireki: opened
* itxi: closed
* jaso: received
* garbitu: cleaned
