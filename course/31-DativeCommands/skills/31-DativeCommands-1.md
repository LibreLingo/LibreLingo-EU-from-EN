# 31. Dative Commands 1
##   31.1  NORI - Dative Case
* The NORI case answers the question “nori”( to whom), and is used to show the indirect object of an action,
* which is the person or thing that an action is done to or for.
* Like for non dative commands, the dictionary form of the verb comes first, then the direct object, then the indirect object.
* For example: Eman baloia hau hari. Give this ball to him/her.
* Note: in the following list of dative pronouns, the pronouns for "to you" and "to you (plural)" are not listed.
* This is because it doesn't make sense to say "You give the ball to you."
