# ​Basics 2

## The NOR/Absolutive case
*   This lesson continues introducing the main parts of the first case in Basque, the NOR/Absolutive case, which is used with the subject of intransitive verbs (verbs without objects) and the object of transitive verbs(verbs with objects), which will be discussed later.

### Nor Case, Single Definite
*   Single definite
    *   Ending: -a
    *   Example: EtxeA (the house)

*   The single definite form of Basque nouns is used give Basque nouns the equivalent of an English article (a/an/the).
*   Izan sentences use the NOR case, so you would add "-a" (mutil → mutila) to single nouns.
*   Note: If the word ends in an "a" in the Indefinite form, another is not added in the Single Definite form.
*   Ex: Neska (girl, a girl, the girl)

Also, if the indefinite form of the word ends in an "r", for the Single Definite form the "r" is normally, but not always, doubled.
+ Ex: Txakur - txakurra, but paper - papera (not paperra).

###Ere(also):
+ Note that the word "ere" goes before the noun it is modifying.
+  Miren ere neska da. Miren is also a girl.

### Izan (to be)
*   Izan sentences use the NOR case mentioned above, so you would add "-a" (mutil → mutila) for single definite nouns.
